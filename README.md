This repository is my own little standard library type thing.

I've implemented the data structures and their algorithms based on their theory, and then I would work out the implementation on paper and do example runs to check my work. For instance, the ExpandingQueue was done by looking at the wikipedia pages for unrolled linked lists and queues.
